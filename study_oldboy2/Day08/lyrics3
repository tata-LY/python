Well I wonder could it be
When I was dreaming about you baby
You were dreaming of me
Call me blind
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do
I do, you know I really really do
Well hey
SO MUCH LIUYANG NEED TO SAY
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but trueOver
Over
Over
Over
Over
with open
